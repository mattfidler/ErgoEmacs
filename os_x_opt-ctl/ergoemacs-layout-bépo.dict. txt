DESCRIPTION: Mac OS X keybinding file for the ErgoEmacs keybinding for BÉPO layout.

INSTALL:
Rename this file to “DefaultKeyBinding.dict”
Then, place the file in this dir:
“~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict”
Create the “KeyBindings” dir if you don't have it already.

Go to your system preference, “Keyboard & Mouse” panel, and swap
Control and Command key positions. So, Control is right under your
thumb.

Now, launch or re-launch any Cocoa application, such as TextEdit. The app should now use ErgoEmacs keybinding.

If you are using emacs, you might want to put the following lines in your “.emacs”:
(setq mac-control-modifier 'meta)
(setq mac-command-modifier 'control)
These lines works for Cocoa emacs, may not work for Carbon Emacs.

If you like to use Option key instead of Control, you can change all ^
to ~ in this file. However, due to some limitations of the OS X
keybinding system, the following won't work:

• Opt+n for move cursor right
• Opt+e for deleting a char to the left
• Opt+u for deleting a char to the right
