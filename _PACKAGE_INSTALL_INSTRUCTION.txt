* Introduction

This is the installation instruction for the ErgoEmacs Package.

The ErgoEmacs Package is a set of elisp files that can be installed on any platform running emacs. (Mac OS X, Linux, Windows) Once installed, you'll have a enhanced version of emacs, with ergonomic keybindings, enhance user interface, and many elisp packages prepared and loaded for you.

The home page of ErgoEmacs is at http://ErgoEmacs.org/

* Requirement

You need to have a working emacs already installed.

Your emacs should be version 23.2 or later. (To find out what is the version of your emacs, type in emacs “M-x version”.)

** Mac

For Mac, you can download emacs 23.2 at
http://emacsformacosx.com/

If you are using Carbon Emacs ( http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html ), as of 2010-06-12, it is not based on emacs 23.2.

If you are using Aquamacs Emacs ( http://aquamacs.org/ ), the latest version on the website should work.

* Installation

** 1. Unzip the package.
Example:

 unzip ergoemacs_1.9.3.1.zip

(The version number is just a example. Yours may be higher.)

** 2. Put the package in your emacs library dir.

Move ergoemacs folder into the directory at 〔~/.emacs.d/〕

So, you should have 〔~/.emacs.d/ergoemacs_1.9.3.1/〕

If the directory 〔~/.emacs.d/〕 does not exist, create it.

** 3. In your emacs init file 〔~/.emacs〕, put the following lines:

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "us") ; US
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/ergoemacs_1.9.3.1/site-lisp/site-start.el")

Make sure the version number there is correct.

If your keyboard layout is not US QWERTY, change the value to one of the
supported layout. (see below for a complete list of possible values.)

Restart emacs.

Now, your emacs should have all the features of ErgoEmacs.

Note that you keybinding is changed, because now it is running ergoemacs-mode
minor mode.  The key 【Alt+x】 to call emacs command is now 【Alt+a】.  To turn
off ergoemacs-mode minor mode, type 【Alt+a ergoemacs-mode】.

* Problems?

If you got some strange error, such as:
“Wrong number of arguments: called-interactively-p, 1”

it might mean there's a bug in elisp type compile incompability.
(see: http://xahlee.org/emacs/elisp_byte_compile_problem.html )

You can recompile all your elisp files. To do so, open the file
〔ergoemacs/build-util/byte-compile_lisp_files.el〕
then call eval-buffer.

If you still have a problem, post a question at:
http://groups.google.com/group/ergoemacs
or file a bug report at:
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/list

* Using Different Keyboard Layout (optional)

Place ONE of the following line in your emacs init file (~/.emacs):

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "us") ; US

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "dv") ; US Dvorak (Ergonomic)

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "gb") ; UK

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "gb-dv") ; UK Dvorak

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "colemak") ; (Ergonomic) Colemak http://colemak.com/

It should be placed before you load the site-start.el file.
