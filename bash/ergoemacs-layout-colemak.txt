# Description: this file makes bash's editing shortucts to be ErgoEmacs keybinding, for COLEMAK layout.
# For layout of ErgoEmacs keys, see: http://xahlee.org/emacs/ergonomic_emacs_keybinding.html

# INSTALL
# to install, rename this file to just ".inputrc"
# place this file in your home dir. e.g. ~/.inputrc
# restart your terminal. Then, bash's keybinding for editing
# should be like ErgoEmacs.
# If no key works, try replace all \M- to \e. That's means change Meta to Esc key.

# doc about how to edit the bash keybinding, see:
# http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Readline-Init-File-Syntax.html
